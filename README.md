# Coba Code Challenge

This README will explain the code challenge to join the Coba Development Team. Make sure you read all of this
file before starting with the code.

## Requirements

- Unix base system(OSX or Ubuntu) or Windows with WSL.
- Rails 6 or higher
- GitHub account to create the repository for later review

### Bonus requirements

You can go with:
- Docker latest version
	- [Docker for mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
	- [Docker for Ubuntu](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce)
  - [Docker for WSL](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/windows/wsl/)
- Docker Compose lastest version
	- [Install Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- [Docker account](https://hub.docker.com/signup)

## Objectives

- [ ] Estimate and complete the stories listed under the [USER_STORIES](./USER_STORIES.md) file
- [ ] Complete the Daily Log, following the template provided [here](./DAILY_LOG.md)
- [ ] Provide the corresponding tests, in this case Unit for models or service classes, and Integration Testing.
- [ ] Deploy the application anywhere you want. Heroku, AWS, GCloud, etc.
- [ ] Use any frontend UI framework you like. Bootstrap, TailwindCSS, Bulma or any other.

**Notes:**

- For the testing suite, you are free to choose the tool of your preference. For example, RSpec, Minitest, Capybara.
- The stories can be perfomed in terms of hours, days, difficulty. Your choice

## Constraints

- You should have 1 pull request at least per story, but you are free to create as many as you want
- The DAILY LOG is just to mimic the async Daily standup, make sure to fill it, be honest and provide as many details as you can
- Work for up to **two hours** per day. This is to mimic a "full day of work" and it is easier to backtrack later.
- There are no restrictions on the gems you can use

## Schedule

**You have 1 week to deliver the application up to the point where you got.**

We are hapy to help you building the challenge, you can always ask for help to any of the developers listed below:

- [Abraham Kuri](mailto:kuri@coba.ai)

## Delivery

Once you are done with the application or the week is over:

- Make sure you send an email to [kuri@coba.ai](mailto:kuri@coba.ai) with the link of your Github repository and the running application
- Include the access for the application, email and password. So make sure you include a seed in yourn project

## Review

To review the challenge we are going to check that your project satisfies the acceptance criteria for each one of the listed
stories, like a regular iteration review on a real project.
