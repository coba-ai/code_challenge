# Daily Log Template

For each entry of the log you should answer the following three questions:

* What I did yesterday?
* What I'm doing today, that is helping the product be better?
* Is something stopping me to achieve my goal today?

Make sure you include the date. Here is an example:

## 2022-03-14

* What I did yesterday?
  - I deployed the application to production, with the sign in user feature
* What I'm doing today, that is helping the product be better?
  - I'm going to work on the tasks module for the CRM. Allowing users to create and tag tasks. Also fix a bug reported by Liliana
* Is something stopping me to achieve my goal today?
  - I have never implement tags in Rails, I may need some guidance. So I'll ask for some help to Kuri.
